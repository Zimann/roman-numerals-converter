# Roman numeral converter

This project has been created when faced with a challenge from freecodecamp.com that involved creating a converter written in JavaScript.

# How can you start converting regular numbers into Roman ones?

  - At the end of the .js file, as the argument (Ex: function(numberArgument)), you can put in any number up to 4999 and the roman numeral will be converted and shown in the console.
## Things to note:
  - For the time being, there is not even an html interface setup but it will come soon enough.
  - This code passes, if tweaked a tiny bit, freecodecamp's challenge checking algorithm, so feel free to use it but make sure you understand it first :).
